Note: Jade.htm has been first developed for 0.9.7. too. I know it's the iconic 1.x default skin, but I did my homework the version I have modified is directly derived from that 0.9.7. release. 
You can find proof of a 0.9.7. release [on the wayback machine here](https://web.archive.org/web/20040611070409/http://hfs.cjb.net/games/LoGD/)

This is pretty much jade as-is, but I also added modern markup. And very notably: I removed the table layout and replaced the custom border frames with a border-image and a tilemap.

I did not attempt to make this mobile friendly. That would require a bigger overhaul.
