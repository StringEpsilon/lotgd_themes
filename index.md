Some LotgD servers are still around and I thought it's a shame the markup is so old. I like the general styles though. Yar2 has always been my favorite template and it's somewhat magical that is somewhat works on mobile too, if you wriggle it a bit.

Also, modern HTML can be much more accessible to people who need screenreaders. LotgD is not a great game for screenreaders to begin with, but if my modifications can help make it just a little bit more accessible, I'll take even a small win.
